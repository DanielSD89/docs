## Working with actions

In terms of a secure and efficient use of GitHub actions it will be highly recommended to follow this **best practices**

### Workflows secrets
Notice that secrets are **not** shared to forked repositories.

Access and manage of secrets works this way:
- For creating at **repo** level: Repository Owner access
- For creating at **org** level: Admin access to the org

Access policy for the secrets
 - All repositories
 - Private repositories
 - Only selected repositories

Don't use structured data (like json): hard to redact

 - Actions can do anything with secrets
 - **Anyone with access to the Action Logs** should be considered to have access to your secrets

### Static code analysis
All code has to be checked through scans for know their possible vulnerabilities.
Always keep dependencies up to date

### Workflows Runners

 A best practice is to run the action inside of a container

As well as **don't use self hosted runners for public repositories**

### Persisting data between runs
Don't share runners (and machines!) between repositories:

Risks:

 - Malicious programs
 - Escaping the runner sandbox
 - Exposing access to the (network) environment
 - Persisting unwanted or dangerous data


### Runners and security

Use actions in workflows from marketplace or by direct url

### Protective measures
Manually:
- Check the action repo code before use
- Check its container images and dependencies before use
- Preferently use actions from verified creators

### Limiting actions altogether
Using a whitelist to manage actions use is highly recommended

**Best practice** for using an action is to pin the action's commit SHA:
``` yaml

```

## Workflow attack vectors

- Forks of public repos
- Common fields

### Forks of public repos

push and pull_request - Safe, runs on merge commit, read only access
pull_request_target - High risks! Runs on the target, has read + write access and can access secrets

### Pull Requests

${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}

### Common fields

```yaml
- name: Check title
  run: |
    title="${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
    if [[ ! $title =~ ^.*:\ .*$ ]]; then
      echo "Bad issue title"
      exit 1
    fi
```
### Remdiation

```yaml
- name: print title
  env:
    TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
  run: echo `$TITLEÂ´
